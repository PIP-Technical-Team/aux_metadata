# pip-metadata
Contains the master file for PIP surveys metadata


## Names of the files

Files `metadata.csv` and `metadata_cols_order.csv` are an exact copy of `pip_metadata.csv` and `pip_metadata_cols_order.csv`, respectively. The have been created for the sake of the new pipeline conventions and are intended to supersede the original files. However, while both pipelines are still in used, both the original and copies should be kept up to date.
